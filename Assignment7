1.  Create Project & User Groups


   A. Create a Project
     
      Sign into Azure DevOps, click New project, enter a name (e.g. MyProject), and click Create.

   B. Add Users & Create Security Groups

      Go to Organization Settings → Users → Add Users, assign access levels (e.g., Basic) and add them to your project 

      In Project Settings → Permissions, select New Group to create groups like Admins, Contributors, Reviewers 

      Add users to these groups via the Members tab 



2.  Branch Policies: Restrict Direct Merge to master

   
  A. Apply Required Branch Policy

     Navigate to Repos → Branches and select the … → Branch Policies for master.

     Enable policies like Require pull request, specify minimum reviewers, linked work items, build validation, etc. 


  B. Secure Branch Permissions

     In Repos → Branches → … → Branch security, add groups:

       Set Contributors:

         Contribute = Deny

         Bypass policies = Deny

       Set Admins:

         Contribute, Bypass policies = Allow 

  
     This ensures Contributors cannot push or bypass PR requirements, but admins still can.



3.  Branch Filters & Path Filters

   #Under Branch Policies, configure:

   Build validation filters: e.g., apply build only on src/* path changes.
   
   Required reviewers by path: auto-add reviewers when certain files change 


4.  Pull Requests Workflow

    Contributors create feature branches and open PRs to master.

    PRs require:

      X reviewers

      Passing builds

      Completed work items linked (optional)

    Only Admins can complete the PR, due to branch permissions.

    Documentation: PR creation, review, and policies 


5.  Build & Release Pipelines Configurations

  A. Apply Triggers

    In pipelines build, configure trigger block for CI on specific branches (e.g., master, release/*) 

  B. Add Gates in Release Pipelines

    In Release → Environments, set Pre-deployment conditions → Gates:

    e.g., Azure Monitor, Work items linked, Approvals, etc. 

6.  Work Items Integration

    Enable Work item linking in branch policies to ensure traceability.

    In build pipelines, add tasks to Automatically link work items from commits/PR descriptions.

    Use Boards to manage backlog and sprint tasks
